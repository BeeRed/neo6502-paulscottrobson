Over the weekend, Andrew Pierce reported on Team Rayner’s frustrations with LOTO. Apparently she’s feeling increasingly sidelined since Labour soared in the polls and Sir Keir consolidated his position. She’s not invited to strategy meetings, doesn’t know when reshuffles are even happening, and is kept off TV. One insider said she’s best deployed on the ground as a campaigner handing out leaflets – which is presumably better than contradicting the party leader on policy every five minutes in front of the cameras. As for Ed Miliband… he’s made just one morning appearance all year.
