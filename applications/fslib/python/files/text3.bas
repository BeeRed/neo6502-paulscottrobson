“We are living in an expensive and increasingly poor country,” thundered The Gua
rdian‘s political editor, furious at the crumbling state of the nation unable to
 pay its workers properly. “It is not much use lecturing people about paying the
mselves more than the country can afford. A better way of putting it is that inc
reasingly the country cannot afford to pay people enough.” A fair point, perhaps
. But this was not a column from the weekend, taking aim at the blundering Bank 
of England governor, Andrew Bailey; it was written 45 years ago, in the depths o
f the Winter of Discontent. As much as some things change, it seems much else ne
ver does.

Are things as bad as they were in 1978? Not on the surface, at least. Back then,
 the dead were left unburied and rubbish piled up in the streets as the governme
nt and trade unions entered into a battle to the death that both would lose. But
 today, like then, spiralling inflation is tearing at the fabric of society, for
cing policymakers to squeeze the life out of the economy just to contain rising 
prices. And this time, it comes after 15 years of stagnant living standards; in 
the Seventies, life for the ordinary worker had improved year on year thanks to 
strong unions who could squeeze real-terms pay rises from employers.

Britain’s post-war economic history could be seen as one long battle against inf
lation and the search for an “anchor” to stop the doom loop of stop-start, boom 
and bust. In the Sixties and Seventies, both Labour and Tory governments adopted
 a “prices and incomes policy” believing that the way to control inflation was t
o manage people’s pay rises and what companies could charge for certain goods. T
his collapsed with the Winter of Discontent and the election of Margaret Thatche
r, who came into power with her own grand theory, monetarism, which also failed.


Next, the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was taken up — only to spectacularly 
collapse in 1992, along with John Major’s economic credibility. At this point, w
e formulated the “inflation target” and then outsourced the problem to the Bank 
of England in 1998: a monetary policy committee of technocratic experts was allo
wed to set interest rates which would keep inflation to this target. With this, 
we believed we had solved the problem.

For most of the next 20 years, inflation was not much of a story. First came the
 boom years of Blair and Brown when, apparently, the business cycle had been abo
lished — an era Mervyn King referred to (tongue firmly in cheek) as the “nice” y
ears of “non-inflationary consistently expansionary” economics, his point being 
that no such thing existed. This was in 2005 and King was worried about rising o
il prices fuelling inflation again. But then came the crash of 2008 and the subs
equent years of austerity and stagnating living standards, cushioned only by the
 record-low interest rates which have now spectacularly come to an end.

Today, with inflation almost in double digits, the Bank of England is squeezing 
the economy hard, ratcheting up interest rates. Sunak, meanwhile, is hinting at 
further wage restraint on public-sector workers to put even more downward pressu
re on the economy in order to hit his own political target to halve inflation by
 the end of the year.

This, some might say, is merely the Bank doing its job: force-feeding the countr
y some necessary bitter medicine. The problem, in other words, is not the system
, or even those in charge of the system, but conditions beyond their control.

But the Bank can’t have it both ways. Were those decades of low inflation really
 thanks to its good judgement? Or could other structural reasons have played a p
art? After 1998, China flooded the world market with cheap goods; immigration fr
om poor parts of Europe soared; and trade unions were no longer powerful enough 
to protect their workers’ living standards.

Many regard the period between 1992 and 2008 as Britain’s golden age, when sensi
ble politics reigned; inflation was low, the economy grew, deficits were sustain
able, debt was low and Britain’s place in Europe was settled. This was the post-
Maastricht, post-ERM settlement: Britain was in the EU but outside the euro, con
veniently placed within both the European single market and the great global fin
ancial system — a trusted, stable, liberally regulated investment opportunity, p
erfectly placed to boom in the 21st century. After decades searching for our ant
i-inflationary anchor, we had found it. We had solved politics. Many people stil
l yearn for this settlement to be rebuilt.

And yet almost every plank of this settlement has collapsed. The financial syste
m blew up in 2008, shattering the British economy and, with it, the New Labour p
olitical settlement on which it was built. A few years later, the eurozone crisi
s revealed the diplomatic weakness of Britain’s place outside the single currenc
y, precipitating David Cameron’s failed attempt to renegotiate the terms of Brit
ish membership, leading to Brexit. Our faith that the Bank of England could cont
rol inflation is one of the last remaining planks left in place. And now that lo
oks close to breaking.

There are good arguments that our current spike in inflation is a blip caused by
 the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But there are other reasons to b
elieve it might be here to stay. China, for example, is no longer simply a mass 
producer of cheap goods, but is turning itself into a high-skilled, hi-tech manu
facturing superpower — a kind of super-Germany. Meanwhile, the great power rival
ry between the US and China is bifurcating the world economy, throwing up protec
tionist trade barriers which will inevitably drive up the price of goods. And fi
nally, the free movement of workers from Europe has ended with Brexit. In short,
 the three structural reasons which might have kept inflation low for 30 years a
re no longer in place. And this is before taking into account the energy transit
ion to “net zero” which most Western governments are currently pursuing.

If we are entering a world of persistent inflation, high interest rates and the 
return of stop-start economics, you can bet that, as night follows day, the sear
ch for a new easy fix will commence — a new “anchor”. If only we returned to the
 EU, our problems would be solved, some will argue. If only we replaced the Bank
 of England’s monetary policy committee with better people; if only we returned 
to some kind of collective pay bargaining; if only we unilaterally abandoned our
 trade barriers. If only, if only, if only.

The truth is we have far less control than we like to admit. To think that we ha
ve solved the inflationary conundrum by outsourcing it to the Bank of England is
 as hubristic as all the other assumptions we made about the end of history in t
he Nineties.

Britain’s central bankers can’t solve the inflation problem in isolation. It has
 one set of tools — interest rates — and these are blunt instruments at best. In
 both the Seventies and Eighties, it quickly became clear that monetary policy a
lone was not enough to deal with inflation; fiscal tightening was also necessary
. And even then, sudden shocks in the global economy completely changed the dome
stic picture, whether the oil price rise of 1973 or oil price crash of 1986.

The other lesson from history is that the battle to control inflation is, by its
 nature, political not technocratic. Whichever method you choose to keep it unde
r control, the burden necessarily falls on one group in society over another. In
 the Seventies, unionised workers protected themselves with good pay rises, whil
e those living on fixed incomes, like the elderly, were badly hurt. Over the pas
t 15 years it has been the opposite. Today, meanwhile, it looks like the burden 
will fall on those with mortgages — a group that has largely avoided the pain un
til now.

While inflation seemed under control in the Nineties and early 2000s, few paid m
uch attention to the distributional consequences of the system, but today the wh
ole structure is back under scrutiny. And so it should be. Not only is the Bank’
s competence fair game, so too is the system itself, resting as heavily as it do
es on interest rate rises over other tools.

With an election on the horizon, we may find ourselves in a new world where the 
Bank of England is working to meet a medium-term target set by a government whos
e other policies are making it harder to reach that target. This was briefly the
 case under Liz Truss, when she tried to put rocket boosters under the British e
conomy regardless of the inflationary consequences. In doing so, she was not act
ing like her hero, Margaret Thatcher, but far more like Ted Heath in 1972 who or
dered his chancellor Anthony Barber to unveil an expansionary budget in time for
 Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community in 1973, wrongly believing
 a virtuous cycle of growth and modernisation was on the horizon.

Truss is unlikely to be the last prime minister to find themselves in conflict w
ith the Bank. Will Sunak really be able to avoid the temptation of an inflationa
ry tax cut before the next election? Don’t bet on it. And if he does cut taxes, 
prepare for the squeeze after the election — and the stop-start cycle begins aga
in.

The eternal truth is that there is no magic cure for Britain’s economic ills — n
o framework which solves our problems forever. Governance is art, not architectu
re: the management of circumstance, not the building of permanent structures. In
flation is back and so too are the politics of inflation. Strap in for a bumpy r
ide.
