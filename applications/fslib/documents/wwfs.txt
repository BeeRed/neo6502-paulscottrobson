WWFS (World's Worst File System)
================================

Designed for very simple usage , using the sector/page structure of the Flash chip. 

The unused memory in the flash chip is divided into sectors of a fixed size (this is 4k bytes). Each 
of those sectors is subdivided into 256 byte pages.

There is no real structure. The 4k sectors (estimate 32 on the base machine) each contain some reference
information and a block of data. Files longer than 4k are represented by multiple sectors in the same format.

There is no serial I/O.

Structure of a 4k sector
========================

Each 4k sector has a 256 byte header (e.g. 1 page)

+00				Type : 'F' if first block of a file, 'N' if next block in a file, any other is a blank sector.
+01 			More : 'Y' if there is more data after this sector, 'N' if this is the last record.
+02..+03 		Number of bytes of data in this sector. (Maximum = 4096-32 = 4064 bytes)
+04..+05 		Total size of file.
+06..+15 		(Reserved)
+16..+31 		Length prefixed file name, lower case.
+32..+255 		Unused

The first sector is different
=============================
+00 			Type : 'I' information
+01				Format version ('1')
+02..+03 		Number of sectors
+04..+255 		Unused.
