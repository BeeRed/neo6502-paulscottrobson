A file system suitable for a few MB of storage in flash memory. As such we want more reading than writing, and for writes to be
spread out so the same sectors aren't repeatedly written. 

The Neo6502 has , or is planned to have, an EN25QH16B 16MBit (e.g. 2 Megabyte). These are arranged in 8192 2048 bit (256 byte) pages.

It can read at 100Mhz. Page programming time is 0.6ms, or 1.67Mhz equivalent. So we can read and waste time reading 60-70 pages for 
every write page.

This likely means no directory. 

- Hashing to place first page ?
- Header from the front, Data from the back ?
