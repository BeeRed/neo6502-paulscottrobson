Haven't seen these anywhere so I dumped them from the respective machines.

The unenhanced iie rom was used prior to the 65c02/mousetext enhancements.
It boots with 'Apple ][' and displays a Venetian blind pattern during the
self test (control-CA-reset).  The text 'KERNEL OK' is displayed when done.
Tested ok with ApplePC, AppleWin, and Apple II Oasis.

The original iic rom shows a shifting hi-res pattern during the
self test (control-OA-CA-reset) which apparently never ends.
Tested ok with ApplePC.
